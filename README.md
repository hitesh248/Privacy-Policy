**Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy is applicable to all mobile applications (hereinafter referred to as "Applications") for mobile devices, which are developed by NextZen Solution (hereinafter referred to as "Service Provider") as Ad-Supported services. These services are provided "AS IS".

**What information do the Applications obtain and how is it used?**  
**User Provided Information**

The Applications acquire the information you supply when you download and register them. Registration with the Service Provider is not mandatory. However, bear in mind that you might not be able to utilize some of the features offered by the Applications unless you register with them.

The Service Provider may also use the information you provide to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices, and marketing promotions.

**Automatically Collected Information**

In addition, the Applications may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use the Applications.

**In-Game Features and Ads**

The Applications may display ads, including banner, interstitial, and rewarded video ads.
In some cases, you may be offered in-game rewards (such as extra moves, retries, or bonuses) in exchange for watching a rewarded ad. These rewards are granted only after successful ad completion.

**Do the Applications collect precise real-time location information of the device?**

These Applications do not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.

The Applications may collect your device’s approximate location, which helps the Service Provider determine your geographical area and make use of it in the following ways:

*   Geolocation Services: The Service Provider utilizes location data to provide features such as personalized content, relevant recommendations, and location-based services.
*   Analytics and Improvements: Aggregated and anonymized location data helps the Service Provider analyze user behavior, identify trends, and improve the overall performance and functionality of the Applications.
*   Third-Party Services: Periodically, the Service Provider may transmit anonymized location data to external services. These services assist in enhancing the Applications and optimizing offerings.

**Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Applications?**

Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Applications and their services. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.

Please note that the Applications utilize third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the Applications:

For example, access to this information is limited to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve their Applications. Please be aware that, although the Service Provider endeavors to provide reasonable security for information processed and maintained, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
